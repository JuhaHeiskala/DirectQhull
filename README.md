DirectQhull
===========

DirectQhull wrapper to Qhull library by accessing Qhull internal data structures directly from Julia.

Interface (v0.1.0) functions exist to get convex hull, Delaunay and Voronoi points.

Interface (v0.2.0) is modelled after Scipy's qhull classes. Currently ConvexHull, Voronoi and Delaunay classes have initial implementation.
